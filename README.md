# xor-gate-toy
This is a simple quad XOR gate (74HC86) that is controlled by 8 key switches and outputs to 4 LEDS, all powered by a coin cell battery. This is implemented in KiCAD.

# Why did you do this?
I wanted to challenge myself by designing a simple PCB without having to follow any YouTube tutorials. This means that I force myself to not copypasta whatever the tutorial did.

# Great. The PCB has already been designed... How do I get it manufactured!?
Coming soon!
